Goal: give more player control of nether and end portals

End portals
✅ Make end portal frame mineable
✅ make frame craftable
    ✅ end stone, obsidian, ender pearl
- make portal creation sound local, not global
- make end portal blocks breakable via liquid source block (nether portal does this already)
- make whole portal break in same way nether portal does
- remove portal frame orientation requirement
- remove size and shape limitations (besides being horizontal, which may need to be implemented because it's vanilla behavior is weird)
- add air block requirement for portal creation to prevent griefing abuse
    - make sure this doesn't affect natural gen

Nether portals
- Make crying obsidian a valid frame block
- allow frame to be removed and not break portal (end portal does this already)
- remove size and shape limitations (besides being vertical)

Other
- find a resource pack that renders portal block sides with portal textures, or implement server-side if possible
