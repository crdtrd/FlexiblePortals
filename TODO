Goal: give more player control of nether and end portals

End portals
✅ Make end portal frame mineable
✅ make frame craftable
    ✅ end stone, obsidian, ender pearl
✅ make portal creation sound local, not global
✅ make end portal blocks breakable via liquid source block (nether portal does this already)
✅ make whole portal break in same way nether portal does
✅ remove portal frame orientation requirement
✅ remove size and shape limitations (besides being horizontal, which may need to be implemented because it's vanilla behavior is weird)
✅ add air block requirement for portal creation to prevent griefing abuse
    ✅ make sure this doesn't affect natural gen
✅ SOLVE BLOCK BREAK SOUND RELATED BUGS
- Solve bucket use not swinging bug

Nether portals
✅ Make crying obsidian a valid frame block
✅ allow frame to be removed and not break portal (end portal does this already)
    ✅ ensure is still breakable via fluid source block
✅ remove size and shape limitations (besides being vertical)

Other
✅ Add frame as valid interior block, but don't allow to be removed
